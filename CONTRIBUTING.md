As I have stated in [README.md](README.md), I use *Skript* paired with for everything related to coding in there, so you have to use this too!

# Code Conventions
1. All work must be properly commented for purpose of letting everyone who is reviewing a pull request know what a particular part of the script is doing
   1. Comments can be added after the initial PR with the contributed material
   2. Commenting:
        ```
        # single hastag - least important stuff
        #! hastag and exclamation mark - important stuff
        #!! hastag and 2 exclamation marks - additional info
        ```
        Follow this format, because of VSC's formatting of comments

2. If you wish to use **skript-reflect** make sure that:
   1. You follow [*skript-reflect's code conventions*](https://tpgamesnl.gitbook.io/skript-reflect/code-conventions)
        - We aren't so strict when it comes to convention #1, but we do when it comes to convention #2 and #4
   2. Don't overuse reflections, e.g. if have to use `event.getBlock()` several times, make it more like this:
        ```applescript
        set {_block_} to event.getBlock()
        {_block_}.doStuff1()
        {_block_}.doMoreStuff1()
        {_block_}.doEvenMoreStuff1()
        ```
        ***Too many reflections lag terribly and slow parse time. Do it like this if you want to use many of the same reflections***
    3. Don't use reflections for something that is possible with vanilla Skript or any of the Addons! Better read [documentation](https://skripthub.net/docs/) first! More on that in [#addons](#addons)!

# Addons
We use several addons to Skript to make our Scripts work. Here is a list with their purposes:

   - **SkQuery** - `AND()` and `OR()` functions, since *SkJade* has a slow parse time with those, branching and some other non-minecraft related features
   - **DiSky** - *wel duh...*
   - **MorkazSK** - sorting of Leaderboard
   - **Skent** - file manipulation
   - **SkImage** - EXP Cards and such
   - **skript-reflect** - calling Java static methods inside Skript
   - **skript-logs** - *not used yet*
   - **skript-db** - MySQL
   - **Reqn** - web requests
   - **SkriptJSON** - mapping bodies of web requests to variables
   - **skript-yaml** - YAML databases
