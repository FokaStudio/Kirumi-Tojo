What do I do! # Just run !!talk once again and all should be fine. Or !!ai , they are both the same command. The percentages on the similarity between the commands are nowhere near! # Yes, I am aware that running command like !!fdsfeisjfjdsfds will return. For the people who are really interested in how this works, I suggest paying a visit here - to see how this is actually calculated, and here , to see the function's origin in code. The bot requests 'Mute Members' permissions in a Voice Channel! Why? # I pushed an update at some point where the Bot requires these permissions to be able to play music in Voice Channels. This was done because Tojo was initialy muted in AFK channels and she couldn't unmute herself . This is a temporar change! Kirumi will soon distinguish between AFK channels and regular ones, so the permissions are required only there. How to fix this? You can do 2 things: Re-adding Kirumi Warning There is no need to remove Kirumi from the server! This tutorial shows you how to refresh the permissions for the bot! Step 1: Head over to the Members List Step 2: Locate Kirumi and click onto her to go to their profile Step 3: Click the big Add to server button and re-add her to your server This causes no data loss, it just refreshes permissions! So don't worry, there is no need to reconfigure everything Editing permissions manually Step 1: Head over to the Roles List Step 2: Locate Kirumi's Role and click on it to edit it Step 3: Allow permission Mute Members to Tojo-san Beware the non-epic fail! This can sometimes fail to work if your channels don't inherit role permissions! (e.g. Role A can talk in #general , but not in #general-no-a ) If that is the case, you have to configure those permissions in the channel's configuration as well.","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"faq/#faq","text":"","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"faq/#i-turned-on-talking-functions-and-i-cant-turn-them-off-what-do-i-do","text":"Just run !!talk once again and all should be fine.
